# Ping Pong Game
This is a simple Ping Pong game implemented in HTML5 and JavaScript. The game features a player-controlled paddle, an AI-controlled paddle, and a bouncing ball. The objective is to prevent the ball from going past your paddle while trying to make the ball go past the AI paddle to score points.

## How to Play
Use the Up Arrow and Down Arrow keys to control the player's paddle.
The AI controls the other paddle.
Keep the ball from passing your paddle and try to score points by making the ball go past the AI paddle.
Code Structure
The code is organized into different sections:

### HTML Structure:

The HTML document contains the canvas where the game is rendered.
It also includes basic styling for centering the canvas and displaying the score.
### JavaScript:

The game logic is implemented in JavaScript within the <script> tag.
Constants, such as canvas dimensions and key codes, are defined.
Game elements are created, including the player paddle, AI paddle, and the ball.
The game loop is set up to continuously update and render the game.
### Game Elements:

# Player: The player-controlled paddle, which can move up and down with arrow keys.
AI: The AI-controlled paddle that automatically follows the ball's vertical position.
Ball: The bouncing ball that interacts with both paddles.
### Game Logic:

The game logic includes functions for serving the ball, updating the position of elements, and checking for collisions.
When a player or the AI scores a point, the game updates the score, displays a message, and resets the ball's position.
### Main Function:

The main function initiates the game by creating the canvas and setting up event listeners.
The game loop is started to continuously update and render the game.
### Initialization:

The init function initializes the game elements and their starting positions.
### Update and Draw Functions:

The update function is responsible for updating the game state, including the ball's movement and collision detection.
The draw function renders the game elements, including the paddles and the net in the middle of the playing area.
Game Over and Restart
The game keeps track of the score, and when a certain score is reached by the AI, it displays a "YOU LOSE" message and ends the game. The background also turns black. If the AI scores a certain number of points, it displays a message indicating that the AI has won.

This simple Ping Pong game provides an example of basic game development in HTML and JavaScript. It can be a starting point for further enhancements and customization
